# ✅ Sign-In Redirect Issue - FIXED!

## 🔍 Problem Diagnosis
The sign-in button was working, but after successful authentication, users weren't being redirected to the calendar page.

## 🐛 Root Cause Found
The `calendar.html` page has a protection script that checks for a specific session storage value:

```javascript
if(!sessionStorage.getItem('taskloomFirebaseSignedIn')){
    window.location.replace('index.html');
}
```

Our new auth system wasn't setting this session storage value, so even after successful sign-in, the calendar page would immediately redirect users back to the index page.

## 🛠️ Fixes Applied

### 1. Added Session Storage in Sign-In Flow
```javascript
// Store session info for calendar.html compatibility
sessionStorage.setItem('taskloomFirebaseSignedIn', '1');
```

### 2. Added Session Storage in Auth State Change
- Sets session storage when user signs in
- Clears session storage when user signs out

### 3. Enhanced Debugging
- Added detailed console logs throughout the auth flow
- Shows each step of the sign-in and redirect process

### 4. Fixed UI Logic
- Sign-in buttons stay visible on index page even for authenticated users
- Other pages hide sign-in buttons appropriately

## 🚀 Sign-In Flow Now Works
1. ✅ Click "Sign In with Google" button
2. ✅ Google OAuth popup opens
3. ✅ User completes authentication
4. ✅ Session storage is set (`taskloomFirebaseSignedIn = '1'`)
5. ✅ Redirect to calendar.html after 1 second
6. ✅ Calendar page loads successfully (no redirect back to index)

## 🧪 Test Pages Available
- `/signin-flow-test.html` - Complete sign-in flow testing
- `/button-test.html` - Button visibility testing
- `/firebase-test.html` - Firebase connectivity testing

The sign-in button should now work perfectly and redirect to the calendar page! 🎉
